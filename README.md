# Generative AI Labs

This repository contains code samples for **Generative AI**, including different use cases. 
Some examples can be executed in Colab, while others would require Vertex AI.
Setup and authentication instructions of Vertex SDK are available [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries). Make sure you install [latest version of the Vertex SDK](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-aiplatform/): `pip install google-cloud-aiplatform --upgrade`. Other dependencies may be required. Please, complete those steps before trying any of the labs below.


## 01 Prompting

* Lab1: Chain-of-Thought
* Lab2: External tools (RAG)
* Lab3: ReAct
* Lab4: ReAct with LangChain 0.1.0 agents
* LangChain specific labs. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is an open-source tool that can orchestrate or integrate APIs (databases, documents, apps, ...) with LLMs. LangChain is **not** a tool for tuning models.
* Ask Database labs: Ask BigQuery and [other databases](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/building-ai-powered-apps-on-google-cloud-databases-using-pgvector-llms-and-langchain) in natural language.

Notes:
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) does not work  with `bigquery-public-data` datasets due to permissions, use a custom dataset instead.
* Make sure your query is not empty, otherwise you will get unexpected non-workable behaviour. You need to fill the input prompt.

```sh
pip install langchain==0.0.191 --quiet
pip install google-cloud-core --quiet
pip install gradio --quiet

# Below libraries are required to build a SQL engine for BigQuery and other DBs
pip install SQLAlchemy --quiet
pip install sqlalchemy-bigquery --quiet
pip install clickhouse-sqlalchemy --quiet
```
